	<h1>All Time Favorite Animes</h1>
	<p>It's hard for me to just choose one anime as I have a bit too many to be able to just choose one but I've got a few that I'd watcched over again</p>
	<h2>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
	<p>This anime is not curently finished yet but so far I've absolutly loved it and 10/10 would rewatch</p>

	<h2>K</h2>
	<p>K project has the most exquisite art style I've ever seen and the fight scenes are emmaculate. It also has an interesting plotline inwhich there are Kings that are given powers and these powers can be shared with their clansmen.</p>

	<h2>Darker Than Black</h2>
	<p>For this anime I only like the first season as it made the most sense to me and its the only season I'm willing to rewatch</p>
	<p>This anime is about people called contracters who have awakened a power but they have to pay price each time they do it. For example if the contracter has the power to manipulate a small flame thier price would be to cut their wrist once. The price is differnet for everyone and when the contracter dies a star is fallen from the fake sky.</p>
	<p>It truly has a amazing plot and is definitly worth the watch</p>

	<h2>The King's Avatar</h2>
	<p>This is a chinese animation but it's about professional e-gamers. This animation also a live adaptation and is very funny. I personally love both the anime and the live version.</p>

	<h2>Durarara</h2>
	<p>This anime is my favorite because of all the action and the drama that is revolved around each charater and how all the stories and people interlock with each other</p>

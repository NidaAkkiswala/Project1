	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Nida Akkiswala and this page is a little about me.</p>
	<p>I am currently 18 years old and a freshman majoring in Information Technology and Managenment</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in Chicago and I love visting the museums in Chicago especially the Museuem of Science and Technology.</p>
	<p>I have three siblings: an older sister, a younger sister, and a younger brother.</p>
	
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>I like playing badminton and was on the girl's badminton team in high school</p>
	<p>Fun fact: My friends and I got together to make the first official badminton team at my high school because at the time we only had a club</p>
	<p>I love watching anime and I've watched a variety of genres my favortie being thriller/mystery/comedy/action</p>
	<p>I like reading books though I haven't been able to much now but my favorite young adult book is Insignia by S.J. Kincaid</p>
	<img src="images/insignia.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="Insignia book cover">
	<p>This book is a dystopian trilogy in which Earth is currently in World War III but with advanced technologies the war is happening in space. The Pentagon recruits teenagers and have chips implanted in their brains and these chips controls the spaceships that were launched in space.</p>
	<p>I really love this book because of two main reasons. The first is that the main character doesn't give two craps about anything but fighting and winning and two because of the author's writing style.</p>
	
	<h2>A Short Memorable Travel Story</h2>
	<p>I love to travel around and exploring new activities in differnet places.</p>
	<p>I've only been to two places outside of the United States which is Saudia Arabia, India, and Canada.</p>
	<p>My family and a few family friends recently traveled to Gatlinburg, Tennessee by car.</p>
	<p>The most enjoyable part of the trip was hiking up the mountains with my family zero gear and discovering small streams of water.</p>
	<p>On our last day there we decided to have a barbecue by a small stream with a moderate current. It was all going well till it started raining, but was that going to stop my desi family from barbecueing, no it was not. It didn't rain long but it was enough to wet some of the food we couldn't cover.</p>
	<p>It is said that you shouldn't swim in the stream as the current could be fast but again was that going to stop a whole bunch of kids from wading to the middle of the stream where a big huge rock was, again no it wasn't. The only casualty we had was my one of my cousin's slides sliding off his foot and into the river.</p>
    <p>Overall it was the best trip I've had so far.</p>

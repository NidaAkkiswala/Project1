	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Nida Akkiswala and this page is a little about me.</p>
	<p>I am currently 18 years old and a freshman majoring in Information Technology and Managenment</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in Chicago and I love visting the museums in Chicago especially the Museuem of Science and Technology.</p>
	<p>I have three siblings: an older sister, a younger sister, and a younger brother.</p>
	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p>I like playing badminton and was on the girl's badminton team in high school</p>
	<p>Fun fact: My friends and I got together to make the first official badminton team at my high school because at the time we only had a club</p>
	<p>I love watching anime and I've watched a variety of genres my favortie being thriller/mystery/comedy/action</p>
	<p>I like reading books though I haven't been able to much now but my favorite young adult book is Insignia by S.J. Kincaid</p>
	<img src = "project1/images/insignia.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="Insignia book cover">
	<p>This book is a dystopian trilogy in which Earth is currently in World War III but with advanced technologies the war is happening in space. The Pentagon recruits teenagers and have chips implanted in their brains and these chips controls the spaceships that were launched in space.</p>
	<p>I really love this book because of two main reasons. The first is that the main character doesn't give two craps about anything but fighting and two because of the author's writing style.</p>
